# Model Card

For additional information see the Model Card paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03993.pdf

## Model Details
* I trained a Random Forest classifier using default hyperparameters.
* model version: 1.0.0
* model date: 2021/08/29

## Intended Use
* This model is intended to predict the Census Income data (>50K or <=50K) based on the list of different features.

## Training Data
* The data comes from UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census+income).
* The dataset contains 48842 rows, and after an 80-20 split 80% of the data was used for training.

## Evaluation Data
* 20% of the dataset was used for testing purposes.

## Metrics
* Evaluation metrics include precision (0.67), recall (0.32) and fbeta (0.43).

## Ethical Considerations
* Demographic data were obtained from the public 1994 Census Database. No new information is inferred or annotated.

## Caveats and Recommendations
* Hyper-parameter should be further tuned.
